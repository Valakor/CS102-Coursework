CS102-Coursework
================

The programming assignments I completed throughout the semester in CSCI 102 - Data Structures.

### Programming Assignments
  + **PA1 - Social Network**
    + A program that creates a rudimentary social network from an input `.gml` file, can add and remove friendships between friends, and outputs the results after these changes to another `.gml` file.
  + **PA2 - Betweenness Centrality**
    + A program that extends some of PA1. Also creates a rudimentary social network; however, PA2 computes the betweenness centrality of every user and outputs the results to a `.txt` file.
  + **PA3 - Game Time**
    + A terminal-based 8-tile puzzle (though it can be of any size, i.e. an 8, 15, or 24-puzzle).
  + **PA4 - Game Time in Qt**
    + An extension of PA3. Implements the same game in Qt instead of the terminal.
  + **PA5 - World of Bombcraft!**
    + Kill as many aliens as possible before you are overrun in Bomberman-style action!
    + A Qt-based game created from scratch for my final project.

### Note
These programming assignments were completed in a VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu. Some require Qt and Doxygen to be installed
to be fully functional.
